Ideas
1. ?playasong
	-sends "!play https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" in preferably beep boop chat.
	-perhaps even have a list of urls that go to songs and it chooses one at random.
2. ?togglegrammar
	-Flips a boolean value making the bot become a grammar nazi or disabling grammar nazi.
	-Make command only available to us somehow.
	-This makes it so we don't have to toss or comment out all the work already done.
3. ?togglelanguage or ?togglecensorship
	-Same as ?togglegrammar except for the swearing.

Comments
1. It's getting to the point where we really need to start using more OO to better organize how the bot works fundamentally.
